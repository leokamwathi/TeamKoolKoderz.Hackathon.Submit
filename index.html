	<h3>Introduction</h3>
	<div>
This Application collects some Personal Data from its Users. Koding, Inc. (“Koding” or the “Company”) is committed to protecting the privacy of your information. This Privacy Statement describes the Koding site and platform privacy practices.
<br/><br/>
<b>Data Controller and Owner</b><br/>
Koding, Inc.<br/>
358 Brannan<br/>
San Francisco CA 94107<br/>
USA<br/>
Email: privacy@koding.com<br/>
<br/><br/>
Koding operates the Koding service and related services, applications, domains and networks offered by Koding ("Koding Service"). Koding’s Privacy Policy is designed to help you understand how we collect and use the personal information you decide to share, and help you make informed decisions when using the Koding Service. By using or accessing the Koding Service, you are accepting the practices described in this Privacy Policy.
</div>

<h3>Information Gathered by Koding</h3>
	<div>
For visitors to our website and registered users, we log standard technical information, such as your IP address. If you choose to register with us, Koding requires you to provide your name, email address, and each user has a user ID and password that they choose. 
<br/><br/>
To maintain privacy it is important not to share your password with anyone. Selecting a longer password with a mix of letters, numbers and symbols makes it more difficult for others to guess your password. It is also helpful to change passwords on a regular basis. 
<br/><br/>
In addition, Koding will require you to provide geographical information such as your physical address. In the future Koding may ask you to provide other demographic information, such as age, gender, interests or occupation, as well as credit card information for verification purposes. 
<br/><br/>
We may collect other personal information when you provide feedback or comments, or communicate with others through our systems. Koding also uses "cookies" – small files containing a string of characters sent to your computer that uniquely identifies your browser – in addition to Flash shared browser objects to administer its website and provide a more tailored and user-friendly service to you. 
<br/><br/>
For example, we may use cookies or Flash objects to count the number of unique computers accessing our website. You can set your browser to refuse cookies from the Koding Service if you choose. When you access the Koding Service or open one of our HTML emails, we may automatically record certain information from your system by using different types of tracking technology. This "automatically collected" information may include IP Address, a unique device or user ID, version of software installed, system type, the content and pages that you access on the Koding Service, and the dates and times that you visit the Koding Service.
	</div>

<h3>Koding Uses of Information</h3>
<div>
The information we collect about you in the course of our relationship is used to provide the Koding Service to you. 
<br/><br/>
For example, as we endeavor to protect your identity, we may use your demographic information to create a database of user profiles, select advertisements based on your information and for marketing analysis. 
<br/><br/>
In addition, we look at technical information to diagnose problems with our systems, to administer the Koding Service, and to enhance the services we provide to you. 
<br/><br/>
We may use your information to track user-generated content and users to the extent necessary to comply as a service provider with the Digital Millennium Copyright Act. 
<br/><br/>
We will use your email address, without further consent, for administrative communications such as notifying you of major updates, for customer service purposes, to address copyright infringement or defamation issues, or to contact you regarding any content that you have posted to or downloaded from the Koding Service service.
<br/><br/>
Koding uses all of the information that we collect to understand the usage trends and preferences of our users, to improve the way the Koding Service works and looks, and to create new features and functionality. 
<br/><br/>
Koding may use "automatically collected" information, "cookies", and Flash objects to: (a) automatically update the Koding Service service; (b) remember your information so that you will not have to re-enter it during your visit or the next time you access the Koding Service; (c) monitor aggregate site usage metrics such as total number of visitors and pages accessed; and (d) track your entries, submissions, participation and status in any promotions or other activities, and usage of the Koding Service.
</div>
<h3>When Koding Discloses Information</h3>
<div>
Koding does not share your personally identifiable information, including any of your user profile data that you create, with other organizations for their marketing or promotional uses. 

Please be aware, however, that 
<br/><br/>
1) any personally identifiable information that you voluntarily choose to display on the Koding Service becomes publicly available and may be collected and used by others without restriction; 
<br/><br/>
and 2) as a feature of the Koding Service, other users may become aware of your behavior or document viewing activities to their own profile pages and may use this information without restriction; provided that you will have the ability to opt out of this feature at anytime.
<br/><br/>
Koding may share personally identifiable information about our users with third parties, including: 
<br/><br/>
(a) with your consent or as otherwise stated in this Privacy Policy; 
<br/><br/>
(b) when we have a good faith belief it is necessary pursuant to a subpoena or other judicial or administrative order; 
<br/><br/>
(c) where required by law; or 
<br/><br/>
(d) at our sole discretion, where we deem necessary to respond to claims, to protect the safety of any individual or the public, or to protect the rights or property of the Koding Service or any third party. 
<br/><br/>
We may disclose personally identifiable information to affiliated companies, sub-contractors, other agents or businesses or persons to: provide web site hosting, maintenance, and security services; fulfill orders; conduct data analysis and create reports; offer certain functionality; and assist Koding in improving the Koding Service and creating new service features. 
<br/><br/>
We require that these parties process such information in compliance with this Privacy Notice, we authorize only a limited use of such information, and we require these parties to use reasonable confidentiality measures to keep your information secure. Koding may also disclose to third parties anonymous aggregated user information that is not personally identifiable.

<h3>Changing or Deleting Your Information</h3>

<br/><br/>
Removed information such as your user ID, geographical information connected to your user ID, and any computer files that you have uploaded to the Koding Service may persist in backup copies for a reasonable period of time, and thus may continue to be publicly available across features of the Koding Service such as its search engine, but will not be generally accessible by Koding or users of the Koding service.

<br/><br/>

<br/><br/>
Koding processes personal information only for the purposes for which it was collected and in accordance with this Policy or any applicable service-specific privacy notice.
